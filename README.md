# StateMachine

Simple implemetation of state design pattern.
I use this state machine for state management in my game loops(e.g.pauseMenu, intro).


To use this piece of code you have to add gameState.cpp and gameState.h files to your projects.
Another files(game.cpp/h intro.cpp/h main.cpp) show how to use this simple machine.
